# Main Website

Repository for [https://tripsit.me/](https://tripsit.me/). Assets generated to create a static website using:

- [pug](https://pugjs.org/) templates for the HTML
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for the style sheets
- A modern JavaScript stack composed of [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) that compiles modern JavaScript into ES5.
